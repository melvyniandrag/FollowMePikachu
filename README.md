# Follow Me Pikachu!
This is a quick demo of how to use sprites in pygame.

We got the sprite sheet for pikachu from the decompiled [Pokemon Yellow Code](https://github.com/pret/pokeyellow/tree/master/gfx/sprites) here.

From there the creative juices start flowing... what can we do with this sprite sheet? 

A natural first thing to do is make Pikachu walk around. 

Looking for a challenge? Why not try:
1. Creating some obstaces on the window. Use `colliderect()` to make sure Pikachu can't walk through them.
1. Keep pikachu on the screen. As it is, he can walk off.
1. Add Ash (also known as Red in the game) and make Pikachu follow him.
1. Dream up anything else!

## Here's how it looks
